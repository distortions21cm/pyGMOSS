# pyGMOSS
This repository hosts a python friendly version of GMOSS maps and some routines for generating radio sky spectra from them. However, it does not have the physically motivated foreground model fitting part - it is not computationally efficient to do them in python without some clever tricks. Rather, codes to generate foreground spectra for a given location with an antenna beam pattern using GMOSS maps will be provided.

A more advanced version of GMOSS is in works and will be fully open-source.

Once the repo is complete, we will have probably have a software paper !
